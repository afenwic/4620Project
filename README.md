# 4620Project
The source code and csv files for the database project by Alexander Fenwick (afenwic) and Jackson Lee (jsl4)

The website is written entirely in php files disregarding the style sheet "style.css." The url provided in the Final Report links to the login page for the website. That page also provides a link to the new user registration page.

When a admin signs in, they will be taken to the admin page. This displays the user table. At the top are two buttons; one takes the admin to the game table, the other takes them to the user search page. Users displayed in the tables on the admin and user search pages have a button next to their name. Clicking this takes the admin to a page that allows them to make changes to the user's account.

When a regular user signs in, they go straight to the game table. At the top of the page is a button that takes the user/admin to the game search page. From the game table or the game search page, the game name's will be presented as buttons. Clicking these buttons will take the user to a review page where they can see and make reviews for the game they clicked on.
